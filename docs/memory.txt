In Enigma, just like it's previous version, this version will also have the same memory format.
The memory will be an array of bytes. The size will be pre-defined and can be increased by the user program
as requested. The memory addresses will have a fixed way of addressing defined unlike the older version.

The memory addresses will be 32 bits long instead of 64 bits long. The first byte will be a header telling
the memory how many bytes that address represents and the remaining 3 bytes will actually be the address.

Every program will start with 1 MB or 1024 bytes of memory. Than according to the needs of the user's 
program, the memory will expand. There will be a limit to how much you can increase the memory size.
The OS itself will stop us.
